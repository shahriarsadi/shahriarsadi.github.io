            <p><strong>Penguins are amazing birds! They are not quite like any bird you have seen before in your backyard or at the park. They have adapted to their cold environment in a way that makes them pretty special. Here are some fun facts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Penguins are flightless birds.</li>
                <li>While other birds have wings for flying, penguins have adapted flippers to help them swim in the water.</li>
                <li>Most penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.</li>
                <li>The Galapagos Penguin is the only penguin species that ventures north of the equator in the wild.</li>
                <li>Large penguin populations can be found in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa</li>
                <li>No penguins live at the North Pole.</li>
                <li>Penguins eat a range of fish and other sealife that they catch underwater.</li>
                <li>Penguins can drink sea water.</li>
                <li>Penguins spend around half their time in water and the other half on land.</li>
                <li>The Emperor Penguin is the tallest of all penguin species, reaching as tall as 120 cm (47 in) in height.</li>
                <li>Emperor Penguins can stay underwater for around 20 minutes at a time.</li>
                <li>Emperor Penguins often huddle together to keep warm in the cold temperatures of Antarctica.</li>
                <li>King Penguins are the second largest penguin species. They have four layers of feathers to help keep them warm on the cold subantarctic islands where they breed.</li>
                <li>Chinstrap Penguins get their name from the thin black band under their head. At times it looks like they’re wearing a black helmet, which might be useful as they’re considered the most aggressive type of penguin.</li>
