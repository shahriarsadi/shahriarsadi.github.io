       <h1 id = "color" class ="font">It is official my favorite Resturant is Tonis Italian Spaceship</h1>  
        <p id = "color2" class = "font2">Man, what a day I had, in all my years living in NYC never have I ever,
        tasted better food then at Tonis Italian Spaceship. You walk in and its a weird place, it has the most bizarre theme of aliens and Italians. But, this is the crazy part the two just go together. You can sit down and be greeted by an alien or an Italian your choice. Then choose between hundreds of meal choices, some standouts seem to be the spaghetti and antenna soup and the lasagna made with real cheese from the moon. You can get saucer-shaped pizza pies and boy are they delicious. This place brings out your inner child and gives a sense of real authentic cuisine. Everyone should come give it a try it really is out of this world. If Italians colonized mars this is what they would be eating. </p>

        <p id = "color2" class = "font2">Toni is such a cool guy that he even gave me the ingredients to his famous pizza so take a look at the ingredients list below. He says he is not afraid to give out the ingredients because he knows that the way he makes his pizza cannot be replicated. He claims big macs can be made by anyone but the alien saucer pizza takes a craftsman of sorts</p>
